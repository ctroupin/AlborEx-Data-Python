\begin{abstract}
AlborEx consists of a multi-platform, multi-disciplinary experiment performed in the Alboran Sea (Western Mediterranean Sea) from May 25 to 31, 2014. It included 1 research vessel, 2 gliders, 3 Argo floats and 25 drifters. The objective was to sample the physical and biogeochemical properties of mesoscale and submesoscale features present in the area and observed by mean of satellite images. A particular attention was paid to the vertical motions generated by these features.

The multi-platform approach allows us to collect in situ measurements of the intense front separating the Atlantic and Mediterranean waters present in Eastern Alboran Sea. Surface salinity measured by the R/V highlighted strong gradients, with values ranging from 36.6 (Atlantic Waters) to 38.2 (Mediterranean Waters) over a few kilometers. In addition, 500 samples (chlorophyll and nutrient concentrations) were collected at 66 CTD stations. Near real-time ADCP velocities showed coherent patterns with currents up to 1~m/s in the southern part of the sampled domain. The drifters, released along the frontal zone, followed a massive anticyclonic gyre for a few days. The glider data capture submesocale structures associated with the frontal zone. The of the Argo floats acquired temperature and conductivity profiles while the Prov-bio float also measured oxygen and chlorophyll-a concentrations, colored dissolved organic matter, backscattering at 700 nm, downwelling irradiance at 380, 410, 490 nm, and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR).

\introduction 

The variety of physical and biological processes occurring in the ocean at different spatial and temporal scales requires a combination of tools in order to properly understand the underlying mechanisms. Numerical models constitute such a tool: they allows one to design specific experiments that can reproduce some of these processes. Despite the continuous progresses made in models (spatial resolution, parameterization, coupling, \ldots), in situ observation remains an essential ingredient when addressing the complexity of the ocean. 

The perfect observational system would consist in dense array of sensors present at many geographical locations, many depths and measuring almost continuously a wide range of parameters. Obviously such a system is not the reality. Researchers have to rely on the combination of various platforms during a limited period of time, each platform measuring a given set of variables at different spatial and temporal resolutions, spatial coverage, accuracy and depth levels. We will refer to this as multi-platform experiment, by opposition to experiments articulated only around the observations made using a research vessel. 

AlborEx is such a multi-platform experiment. The exercise was performed in the Alboran Sea from from May 25 to 31, 2014, with the objective of getting a deep understanding of the meso and submesoscale processes taking place in this area. The combination of all the platform during that period, described in the next Section, constitutes a particularly rich data set due to the variety of platforms and measured variables concentrated on a relatively small area.

\section{The AlborEx mission}

The particularity of the mission is that the exact sampling area was not known until a few days before the start. Prior to the experiment, satellite images of sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll-a (chla) concentration were acquired in order to provide a general view of the surface features visible in the Alboran Sea. The selected feature of interest was a well-defined front (Fig.~\ref{}) separating Atlantic and Mediterranean waters. 

\subsection{Mission objectives}

Once the area of interest was selected, the main objective was to study the dynamics of the frontal zone and its influence on the biology through a multi-platform, multidisciplinary sampling of the area. The interaction of various scales, in particular mesoscale and submesoscale, makes the observational component of the study particularly challenging. This is why a combination of sensors was deployed simultaneously. 

Of particular interest is the evaluation of the intense vertical motions related to the strong horizontal gradients of sea water properties encountered in the vicinity of the front. These vertical motions 

\subsection{Sampling strategy design}

The section aims to summarize the motivations behind the sampling and deployments. An extensive description of the available data is the object of the next section.

While the remote sensing data represented a meaningful source of information about the front and the small scale features, in situ observation were essential to fulfill the mission objectives. The SOCIB R/V was used to sample the area with vertical profiles acquired though the CTD. Two distinct CTD surveys were performed on a 10 km $\times$ 5 km regular grid. The first survey was run from May 26 to 27 and consists of 34 casts along 5 meridional legs (Fig.~\ref{}). The second survey took place from May 29 to 30 and was made up of 28 casts. These casts were performed at almost similar locations as those of the first survey in order to allow for comparison. 

In addition to the CTDs, the R/V continuously acquired temperature and conductivity along the ship track thanks to the thermosalinograph, from which near surface salinity is derived. Direct measurements of currents were performed during the night (from 10PM UTC to 6AM UTC) and during the 2 CTD surveys, using an acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP). The R/V weather station measured air temperature, pressure, wind speed and direction during the whole duration of the mission.

To collect measurements able to address the submesoscale, two gliders were deployed on May 25 inside the study area. The coastal glider carried our measurements up to 200~m depth against 500~m for the deep glider. The horizontal resolution was about 0.5~km for the shallow and 1~km for the deep glider. The initial plan was to have two 50-km meridional tracks, 10 kilometers away one from the other, and to repeat these tracks up to 4 times during the experiment. However, due to the strong eastward currents, different tracks (Fig.~\ref{}) crossing the front several times were made instead.

On May 25, 25 Surface Velocity Program (SVP) drifters were deployed in the frontal area in a tight square pattern (mean distance between drifters around 3~km). Almost all the drifters also provided measurement of the sea water temperature near the surface. On the same day, three Argo floats were programmed to cycle	at intervals ranging from 3 hours to 5 days and to depths up to 2000~m.	

\section{Description of the database}

The AlborEx mission generated a large amount of data in a region scarcely sampled in the past. The synergy between lower-resolution (CTD, drifters) and high-resolution data (ADCP, gliders) makes this dataset unique for the study of submesoscale processes in the Mediterranean Sea. Moreover its multidisciplinary nature makes it suitable to study the interactions between the physical conditions and the biogeochemical variables.

\subsection{Oceanographic context}

The description of features and processes occurring during the mission is not in the scope of this paper. However a brief summary is useful to better understand the general context of the data acquisition. The interested reader is invited to consult \cite{RUIZ2015} for a extensive description of the mission and \cite{PASCUAL2017} for the main findings deduced from the in-situ observations.

Before the campaign, a frontal zone separating warm and cold waters was identified at a longitude between 0 and 1$^{circ}$W. The front was developing around an anticyclonic circulation south of it and displayed filament-like structures (Fig.~\ref{}). During the field experiment, the frontal zone and the associated filaments persisted, with the anticyclonic eddy centered around 36$^{\circ}$30'N, 0.5$^{\circ}$W according to altimetry data. The eddy slowly followed an eastward trajectory in the following days.
